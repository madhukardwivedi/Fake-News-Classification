# Fake-News-Classification

The dataset you can get from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data


In this Project, i have used Bag of Words, TF-IDF with machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Random Forest. 


I have also used deep learning LSTM RNN with TF-IDF which gave the heighest accuracy of 90.3%.
