# Fake-News-Classification

The dataset you can get from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data

In this Project, i have used Bag of Words, TF-IDF with machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

TF-IDF with Random Forest excelled all and gave best accuracy of 94.31%. 

I have also used deep learning LSTM RNN with Word2Vec which gave the accuracy of 90.3% but was much faster than any other methods.
